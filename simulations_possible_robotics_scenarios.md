## Scenario ideas

    - Line follower
    - Obstacle avoidance, avoid lava
    - capture the flag
    - goal location (robot delivery)
    - combination of problems (useful to teach filters, timescales - and to use strength of each sensor in its strong time-scale)



## Simulation custom environment

We generate a very nice instructions and simulation environment for students to build their own robotics scenarios (we provide sensors, motors, ability to edit fields, and also some generic/pre-configured bundles of robot/sensor/motors + field, so that students don't have to start from scratch).

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: it should be easy to understand what is happenning - there should be a nice debugging method, easy visualization for true vs sensor measurement.
It should also be easy to turn off the harshness/reality switch a little bit (noise, friction, etc).
